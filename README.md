# A GTFS Parser
## What is This?
This code is programmed in **C++** and is one big file in `main.cpp` and is used to parse general *GTFS Static Data*. 

## How do I use it?
Create a folder in the enviroment labelled `data` or wherever you want and change the paths inside the code. I didn't include the GTFS data that I used for testing as it is way too big to fit onto Github.

## If you are in pain reading this code
If you are in pain reading this code just copy it and improve it. I don't care about licencing; Just do whatever you want with it. Go wild.

## What libraries do I need?
Nothing. Just a C++ compiler. All of the libraries used are built in like `<string>`, `<vector>`, and `<map>`.

## What are the other files from the root?
There are some other random files that I use to create and test functions, structs, and classes from. You might see some snippets from those files into the `main.cpp` code but all you need to run it is the `main.cpp` code.

## What are my goals for the future?
Just try and implement *Live GTFS* Data including schedules and bus locations.
