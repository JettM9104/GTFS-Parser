# static-gtfs

C++ header library for parsing GTFS Schedule data. All functionality lives in `gtfs.hpp`. No build system required, just include it.

## Background

Transit agencies publish GTFS Schedule data as a `.zip` of `.csv`-formatted `.txt` files. The spec is [here](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/). For larger agencies (major cities), files like `stop_times.txt` can exceed 200,000 lines.

**Required files** (agency must provide):

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `agency.txt` | Agency info and `agency_id` |
| `routes.txt` | Route info and `route_id` |
| `trips.txt` | Trip info and `trip_id` |
| `stop_times.txt` | Scheduled times, references `trip_id` |

**Common optional files:**

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `stops.txt` | Stop locations and `stop_id` (required unless `location.geojson` is provided) |
| `calendar.txt` | Weekly service schedules |
| `calendar_dates.txt` | Service exceptions (added/removed service days) |
| `fare_attributes.txt` | Fare pricing and payment info |
| `frequencies.txt` | Headway-based frequency info |
| `feed_info.txt` | Feed validity dates |

## Setup

### 1. Add your GTFS data

Create a `data/` folder inside `static-gtfs/` and extract your agency's `.zip` there:

```
static-gtfs/
├── gtfs.hpp
└── data/
    └── your_agency/
        ├── agency.txt
        ├── routes.txt
        ├── trips.txt
        ├── stop_times.txt
        └── ...
```

### 2. Configure paths in `gtfs.hpp`

**Line 37** — set `path` to the subfolder inside `data/` that contains your `.txt` files:

```cpp
const string path = "/data/your_agency/";
```

**Line 38** — set `root` to the absolute path of the `static-gtfs/` directory:

```cpp
const string root = "/path/to/static-gtfs" + path;
```

To find your absolute path, run `pwd` (Mac/Linux) or `cd` with no arguments (Windows).

### 3. Verify the setup

Create a `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ctime>
#include "gtfs.hpp"

int main() {
    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    std::tm* now = std::localtime(&t);
    std::cout << gtfs::verifyGTFS(now->tm_year + 1900, now->tm_mon + 1, now->tm_mday) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```zsh
clang++ -std=c++17 -O3 main.cpp -o main && ./main
```

`verifyGTFS` return values:

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Data read and valid |
| `1` | Data read but feed is expired |
| `-1` | Data read but feed has not started yet |
| `10` | `feed_info.txt` not found |
| `11` | `feed_info.txt` missing `feed_end_date` |
| `12` | `feed_info.txt` missing `feed_start_date` |
